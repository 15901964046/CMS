Bootstrap CMS was created by, and is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell), and provides some testing functionality for [Laravel 4.2](http://laravel.com). It relies on 12 of my packages including [Laravel Core](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Core) and [Laravel Credentials](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Credentials). Feel free to check out the [change log](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/releases), [license](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/blob/master/LICENSE.md), [screenshots](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/blob/master/SCREENSHOTS.md), [api docs](http://grahamcampbell.github.io/Bootstrap-CMS), and [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
