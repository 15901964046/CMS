## THIS ALPHA RELEASE IS FOR TESTING ONLY


## What Is Bootstrap CMS?

Bootstrap CMS is a PHP CMS powered by [Laravel 4.0](http://laravel.com) with [Sentry 2.0](http://docs.cartalyst.com/sentry-2).  

* Bootstrap CMS, in its current form, is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell).  
* Bootstrap CMS will eventually use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS) to run tests to check if it's working as it should.  
* Bootstrap CMS uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to load dependencies and all licenses for dependencies can be resolved from there.  
* Bootstrap CMS is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3, available [here](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/blob/master/LICENSE.md).  


## System Requirements

Bootstrap CMS was designed to run on a Linux machine with PHP 5.4 and MySQL 5.5.  

* PHP 5.3.7+ or PHP 5.4+ is required. PHP 5.5+ may work, but is untested.  
* MySQL 5.1+, 5.5+, or 5.6+ is required. MySQL 5.7+ may work, but is untested.  
* You will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed to load the dependencies of Bootstrap CMS.  
* You will need to configure the site in the app/config folder before production.  
* Some features require a cache server like [Redis](http://redis.io) and a queuing server like [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd).  


## Installation

Please check the system requirements before installing Bootstrap CMS.  

1. Clone this repository to your server.  
2. From a command line open in the folder, run "composer install".  
3. Navigate to app/config, and adjust the config accordingly.  
  * If you don't want Boostrap CMS to send emails, you can disable that in cms.php
  * If you don't have a cache server like [Redis](http://redis.io), disable caching in cms.php
  * If you don't have a queuing server like [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd), set queue.php to use "sync"
4. You can run "php artisan app:install" to setup and seed your database.  
  * Make sure you setup your database config in database.php.  
5. Finally, setup and [Apache VirtualHost](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/examples.html) to point to the "public" folder
  * For development, you can simply run "php artisan serve"


## Updating Your Fork

The latest and greatest source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS).  
Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.  

You may fork the Bootstrap CMS:  

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS.git

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).  

You can then update the branch:  

    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.
